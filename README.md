This is a dumping ground for various little projects related to understanding Core Data better by re-implementing parts of it.

Currently this includes:

- a half-baked replacement for parts of `NSFetchedResultsController` (including section support)
- a simple `NSAtomicStore` subclass that uses binary plist under the hood

None of this is intended for outside consumption. Everything is hacky, experimental code.
